# Preventing Drug abuse using analytics

Ever since I moved to the city of Charlotte, I have fallen in love with every square inch of it. Like other cities, the city of Charlotte faces some problems. Motivated to fight the issue of drug abuse, I participated in a hackathon organized by ABD Society that strives to develop educational programs that model effective data use and functional business strategies. During the 24-hour coding marathon, we tackled the problem of drug abuse using analytical tools to accurately predict whether patients will complete treatment, as well as their length of stay. Built an engineering solution that allows a user to interact with the model or enable the model to serve decisions to an application.
